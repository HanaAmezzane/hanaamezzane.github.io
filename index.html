    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>A model that with luck will match the function of the mystery black box is most likely going to match the real mystery black box.</p>
    <h2>Evidence </h2>
    <p>The mystery black box contained a mystery system inside. When you pour water inside, a different amount gets emitted. In one trial that we all looked at in a class, the teacher poured 500ml of water inside of the box and 0ml of water came out. We built our own model based on the data that we collected. We ran some tests on our model based on how we thought the real mystery box was set up. There were drastic changes based on the input and output. For example one test we did we poured 370ml of water into our box and only 245ml came back out. We did another test on our model and we poured 200ml of water and 0ml came back out. </p>
    <h2>Reasoning</h2>
    <h4>Reasoning 1</h4>
    <p>A model is a prototype. It’s a smaller version you make before creating the real size version. They’re good because you can see what it will look like and work out the problems before you invest in making a real size product</p>
    <h4>Reasoning 2</h4>
    <p>Based on our data and the performance of our model it is likely very similar to the true structure of the real mystery box. For example the weight, the sound, and input v.s output, we can confidently say that our model of the box is likely similar to the function of the real mystery box.</p>
